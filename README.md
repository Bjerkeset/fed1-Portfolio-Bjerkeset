# PORTFOLIO WEBSITE ASSIGNMENT

Portfolio website course delivery.

## Description

This assignment represents the culminating project for the first year at Noroff Front-end studies. The primary goal of the website we're creating is to serve as a comprehensive portfolio, illustrating the breadth and quality of my work thus far in my career.

Due to the strict time constraints for this course, the current version of the website will subsequently undergo further refinement. This polished version, complete with an enhanced design and additional features, will be accessible in the future at https://bjerkeset.dev.

The website is intuitively structured into three primary sections:

- Hero section
- About Section
- Portfolio Section.
